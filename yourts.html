        <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trail</h2> 

        <h3>What is a Yourt</h2>
        <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has <br>
         canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck. <br>
         </p>

        <h3>How are the yurts furnished</h2>
        <p>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy <br> 
        couch, dining table and  chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your<br>
        luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water.<br>
         Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.<br>  
        </p>

        <h3>What Should I bring?</h2>
        <p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing<br>
            weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and<br>
            a sense of adventure!</p>
